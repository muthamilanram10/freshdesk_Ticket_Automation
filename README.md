**Freshdesk Ticket Workflow Implementation**

**Overview**

This implementation integrates Freshdesk API services with a Node.js application to automate ticket creation, assignment, interaction, and closure workflows. The system utilizes cron jobs for scheduling automated actions, enabling dynamic communication between customers and agents.

**Key Components**

**1. Freshdesk Service Module (services/freshdesk.js)**

This module encapsulates Freshdesk API operations such as fetching contacts, agents, creating tickets, assigning tickets, adding replies, and closing tickets.

**Methods:**

**getContacts():** Fetches active contacts from Freshdesk.

**getAgents()**: Retrieves a list of active agents.

**createTicket(subject, description, email):** Creates a new support ticket.

**assignToAgent(ticketId, agentId):** Assigns a ticket to a specific agent.

**addReply(ticketId, replyType, id, message):** Adds a reply (from agent or customer) to a ticket.

**closeTicket(ticketId):** Marks a ticket as closed.

**2. Main Workflow (index.js)**

This script orchestrates ticket creation, assignment, and automated interaction between agents and customers using scheduled tasks.

**Functions:**

handleTicketWorkflow(ticketDetails):

Handles scheduled communication for an active ticket.

Uses cron for time-based scheduling.

Scheduled tasks include:

Agent Initial Reply: Simulates an agent's response after ticket assignment.

Customer Reply: Simulates a customer response.

Agent Resolution Reply: Simulates the agent providing a resolution.

Close Ticket: Closes the ticket automatically after interactions.

createAndHandleTicket():

Initiates the ticket creation process.

Randomly selects a contact and agent.

Creates and assigns a ticket.

Passes ticket details to handleTicketWorkflow().

**3. Environment Configuration**

**Environment Variables:**

FRESHDESK_URL: Base URL for Freshdesk API.

FRESHDESK_API_KEY: API key for authentication.

dotenv: Used for loading environment variables.

**4. Cron Job Scheduling**

Initial Ticket Creation Cron:

Schedules ticket creation hourly (0 * * * *).

**Task-Specific Crons:**

***/5 * * * ***: Agent's first reply.

***/10 * * * ***: Customer's reply.

***/15 * * * *:** Agent's resolution reply.

***/20 * * * *:** Closing the ticket.

Execution Flow

**Ticket Creation:**

Selects a random contact and agent.

Creates a ticket and assigns it to the agent.

**Workflow Execution:**

Initiates communication tasks using cron.

Tracks message history in messageHistory.

**Closure:**

Marks the ticket as closed after completing interactions.

**Dependencies**

Node.js Modules:

axios: For HTTP requests to Freshdesk API.

dotenv: For environment variable management.

node-cron: For scheduling tasks.

logger (custom): For logging errors and workflow events.

**Logging**

Logs are maintained for:

API responses and errors.

Ticket creation, assignment, and replies.

Workflow progress and task completion.

**Benefits**

Automation: Reduces manual effort in ticket management.

Scalability: Supports handling multiple tickets simultaneously.

Dynamic Communication: Simulates real-time interactions between agents and customers.
